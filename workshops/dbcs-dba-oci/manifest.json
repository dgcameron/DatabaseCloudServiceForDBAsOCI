The labs will walk you through creating and accessing a new Database Cloud Service instance.  You will explore some common use cases for moving your data from on-premises to the cloud.  Next, you will use the Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module and RMAN to backup your on-premise data to the Oracle Public Cloud and then recover lost data.
